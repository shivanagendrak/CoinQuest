Influences (Brief)
- Markus
I derived inspiration for this game from the Creeper attack system in Minecraft. In Minecraft, Creepers approach the player at night and explode. This concept served as the basis for the game I'm developing.
The elevator Pitch
The game is a fast-paced, story-driven experience where players must collect coins while evading enemies. Contact with any enemy results in the game ending.
Project Description:
In this game, players need to gather scattered items and navigate through traps. The campaign comprises multiple levels, each progressively more challenging
Core Gameplay Mechanics
- Coin Collection and Enemies
- Coin Collections
The Player has to collect coins as much as possible. These coins will be scattered through the map randomly.
- Enemies
Enemies are the thing that makes this game more thrilling. Players have to be safe from the Enemies because they will tail the player throughout the level and new enemies will land on the player to kill him.
Story and Gameplay
Story
 In the mystical realm of Numisia, a once-thriving civilization built upon the magic of ancient coins, a dark force has stolen the most valuable and powerful coins, plunging the land into chaos. The player steps into the shoes of Alexia, a young and ambitious

 coin collector with a legendary family legacy. With a magical coin detector passed down through generations, Alexia embarks on a heroic journey to restore balance to Numisia.
The tale begins as Alexia discovers an ancient prophecy foretelling the restoration of Numisia through the gathering of the "Eclipsed Coins." These mythical coins hold the key to unlocking a powerful artifact that can thwart the malevolent forces threatening Numisia. Guided by a wise mentor named Numisarius, Alexia sets off on a quest that takes her through enchanted forests, treacherous mountains, and ancient ruins.
Throughout the journey, players encounter diverse characters, both allies and foes, each with their own coin-related abilities. Alexia must strategically navigate through puzzles, overcome challenges, and outsmart magical guardians to retrieve the lost coins. As the collection grows, the player unlocks the rich history and unique powers embedded in each coin, contributing to the unfolding narrative.
The storyline weaves in elements of mystery, friendship, and self-discovery as Alexia uncovers the truth behind the theft of the Eclipsed Coins. The player faces moral choices that impact the outcome of the story, adding a layer of depth to the narrative.
Ultimately, Alexia's quest culminates in a showdown with the dark antagonist, who seeks to use the stolen coins for nefarious purposes. The fate of Numisia rests in the hands of the player, as they must harness the power of the collected coins and make strategic decisions to save the realm from impending doom.
"Chronicles of Numisia" offers not only an engaging coin-collecting experience but also a captivating story that immerses players in a fantastical world of magic, mystery, and numismatic wonders.
